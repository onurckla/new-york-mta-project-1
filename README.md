WomenTechWomenYes (WTWY) organizes an annual gala to empower women in tech. They deploy street teams at metro stations, collecting emails and offering free gala tickets. WTWY seeks to optimize their efforts by leveraging MTA metro data with the help of experts like Vinny and Julia. This data-driven approach will expand their outreach and support their mission of promoting diversity in technology.
